As I see it, yes.
Ask again later.
It is probably best you don't know.
Cannot predict now.
Concentrate and ask again.
Donâ€™t count on it.
It is certain.
It is decidedly so.
Most likely.
My reply is no.
My sources say no.
Outlook good.
Outlook not so good.
Reply hazy try again.
Signs point to yes.
Very doubtful.
Without a doubt.
Yes.
Yes, definitely.
You may rely on it.
Oh, oh, no. Definitely no.
Girl, you know it~
Maybe?
How do you expect me to know this?
YES!
100% yes! .. Or wait.. Was it 100% no? It was 100% something.
Potentially almost maybe some-what kind-of hypothetically possible, I think.
Sorry, I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
Yes, it's obvious, really.
No, you should know that.
Unfortunately, no.
Unfortunately, yes.
Only if you believe hard enough.
Totally possible.
Highly unlikely.
Hah. ... Oh, you were serious? No. The answer is no.
Yesssssssssssss
Please ask again later, I'm trying to take a nap.
My sources say, "Who are you?! How do you keep finding me? Please, leave me alone! I don't know! I never know any of these questions!"
A complete and unquestionable, no.
A complete and unquestionable, yes.
There's a small chance.
There's a pretty good chance.
You know, strangely enough, you're not the first person to ask me that.
The answer yesterday was yes, however, now that you have asked, the answer is no.
I don't think so.
-shrug-
Sure, why not?
No, now stop asking.
Maybe, have you tried Googling it?
Great question, I have no idea.
Absolutely.
Not a chance.
